# 27NumbersTrick
Basic and Simple JavaScript Trick with Numbers

Trick based on The 27 card trick.

The origin of the 27 Card Trick is a bit challenging to attribute to a single inventor, as many magic tricks and illusions evolve over time through the contributions of various magicians and performers. The 27 Card Trick is a variation of other card tricks that involve mathematical principles.

This Trick is a classic magic trick involving playing cards. The magician appears to be able to determine the card a spectator has chosen even though they never reveal it.
The trick typically involves a set of 27 cards. The spectator is asked to select a card from this set, memorize it, and then return it to the set without revealing their choice.
The magician, using their knowledge of the set and a specific pattern or algorithm, can correctly identify the chosen card. It often appears as if the magician is "mind-reading" the spectator's choice.
The trick is a combination of mathematical principles and presentation, making it a fascinating and mystifying illusion.

Ternary Numbers (Base 3):

Ternary numbers are a type of numeral system, like binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10). However, in the ternary system (base 3), numbers are represented using three digits: 0, 1, and 2.
In base 3, each position in a number represents a power of 3, just as each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10. For example, in ternary, 10 represents three in decimal.
Ternary numbers are often used in various mathematical and computational applications, especially in areas related to computer science and cryptography.
The magic trick often exploits the concept of ternary numbers by having the spectator convert their chosen card's position to ternary and then using this converted number as input to a predetermined algorithm to reveal the chosen card.
In the context of the 27 Card Trick, the magician may use a ternary representation of the card's position to determine the chosen card, adding a mathematical and logical element to the illusion.

The specifics of the trick and the algorithm can vary from one performance to another, but it's a classic example of how mathematics and magic can come together to create an intriguing spectacle.
